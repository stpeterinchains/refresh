# The Cathedral of Saint Peter-in-Chains

This repository contains the source for a Google Cloud Function that supports the website of [The Cathedral of Saint Peter-in-Chains](https://stpeterspeterborough.ca/), an historic church located in Peterborough, Ontario.

The website is a Jekyll-based static site which uses Twitter as a way for staff to push updates to content on its home page. The cloud function that lives here is part of the implementation.

See the [website source repository](https://github.com/stpeterinchains/stpeterinchains.github.io) for information about the site and the role of this cloud function.
